# Maze Solver | Path Finder with Python

This is a simple maze solver written in Python using the curses library for terminal graphics.

## Installation

To run this program, you will need to have Python 3.x installed on your computer. You can download Python from the official website.

Additionally, you will need to install the curses library. If you are using a Unix-based system (e.g. Linux, macOS), this library should already be included with your system. If you are using Windows, you may need to install it separately.

## Usage

To use the program, simply run the `main.py` script from the command line:

```bash
  python main.py
```

The program will display the maze and highlight the shortest path from the starting point (marked with an 'O') to the end point (marked with an 'X').

You can modify the maze by editing the `maze` variable at the top of the script.
